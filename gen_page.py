As necessitated by the nature of differential privacy, this course will be theoretically and mathematically based. References to practice will be provided as relevant, especially towards the end of the course. Prerequisites include an undergraduate understanding of algorithms, comfort with probability, and mathematical maturity.',

The course explores this question, starting from the problems faced by straightforward solutions and moving on to rigorous state-of-the-art solutions using differential privacy. The class will focus on foundations, but also delve into some applied work and on some of the social, ethical, and legal context for the subject. Students will be required to complete some mathematical assignments, some light programming assignments, and a final course project.',
